Senior Design Project: IoT Home Security System

This repositiory consists of code to run the application server which handles all of the local sensor statuses.
From the application server, changes to a database (which holds sensor information) can be made.
An alarm will be triggered if there is enough sensor data.

The application server will also respond to requests made by the SecurIoTech Alexa voice skill service.
This allows the user to be able to communicate verbally with their home security system, as opposed to
having to use a confusing keypad interface.
